############################CodeDeploy Concept
CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services.
Codedeploy can deploy code,script, files, lambda function, packages etc. The code or required packages can be on S3, Github, etc
CloudBUild can also the deploy the code. However CodeDeploy lot of extra features over Codebuild. Deployment Stratery is one of the main feature.
Which is very importan and defines how the deployment would be perfomerd like BlueGreen or Canary.
We can use CodeDeploy with Below compute platforms:
1) EC2/On Premises Servers ------using an in-place or blue/green deployment type
3) Lambda ---- canary, linear, or all-at-once configuration
4) ECS  ------a canary, linear, or all-at-once configuration.

##################################Core Components######################
1) Deployment Group --- A deployment group is a set of individual instances 
2) Deployment  ----  A deployment type is a method used to make the latest application revision available on instances in a deployment group.
3) Deployment Confguration ---A deployment configuration is a set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions.EC2/On-Premises compute platform, you can specify the 
                              minimum number of healthy instances for the deployment. If your deployment uses the AWS Lambda or the Amazon ECS compute platform, 
                              you can specify how traffic is routed to your updated Lambda function or ECS task set.
4) Revision  ------- A revision is a version of your application.
5) Application ---An application is a name that uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy.It functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision, 
                  deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment.
